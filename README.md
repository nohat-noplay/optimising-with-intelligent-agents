# Optimising with Intelligent Agents ü§ñüêùüêú
Year: 2025

A collection of nature-inspired optimisation algorithms, exploring how intelligent agent behaviours can be used to solve complex problems through swarm intelligence and evolutionary processes.

## Important Notes for the User:
_This repository is currently private pending permission from project collaborators._

## Project Overview
This project implements a suite of metaheuristic algorithms, focusing on evolutionary and swarm-based techniques such as:

- Genetic Algorithms (GA)

- Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)

- Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)

These algorithms are widely used to solve complex optimisation problems where traditional deterministic methods are inefficient or infeasible.

_The project was developed as part of a group project. The code is currently private while permissions from collaborators are being finalised._

## Features
**Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Mimics natural selection through crossover, mutation, and selection.

**Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)**: Simulates a group of particles (agents) exploring the search space using personal and collective experience.

**Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)**: Inspired by how ants use pheromone trails to find optimal paths.
